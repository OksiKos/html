    <p>Ukraine is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest European country after Russia, which it borders
        to the east and northeast.[a][11] Ukraine covers approximately 600,000 square kilometres. Prior to the ongoing
        Russo-Ukrainian War, it was the eighth-most populous country in Europe, with a population of around 41 million
        people.[c][6] It is also bordered by Belarus to the north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by
        Romania and Moldova[d] to the southwest; with a coastline along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south
        and southeast. Kyiv is the nation's capital and largest city. Ukraine's official and national language is
        Ukrainian</p>
    <p>The Slavic word "Ukraine" is mentioned for the first time in the Kyiv annals according to the Ipatiev list under
        the year 1187. It outlined the territory of the Pereyaslav principality, which was part of the historical core
        of Russia, next to the Kyiv and Chernihiv principalities. This word is also found in Russian chronicles under
        the years 1189, 1213, 1280 and 1282, denoting Halychyna, Western Volhynia, Kholmshchyna and Podlasie. In
        Lithuanian and Polish chronicles and official documents of the 14th–17th centuries, the Russian lands of
        Halychyna, Volhynia, Kyiv region, Podillia, and Bratslav region were called "Ukraine" in the broad sense, and
        the territory of the middle Dnieper region in the narrow sense.</p>

        the East European Plain. They connect the Polis, Dnipro, and Black Sea lowlands, which occupy 70% of the surface
        of Ukraine, as well as the Volyn, Podil, Dnipro, Donetsk, and other highlands. The average absolute height of
        the plains is 175 m. In Ukraine, there is the highest point of the East European plain — Mount Berda, 515 m
